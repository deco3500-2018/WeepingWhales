### Project Aims
We want to gain a better understanding of whether visualising people’s contribution to environmental protection helps motivate them to reduce plastic bag usage.Through developing a prototype and doing user testing, interviews and surveys, our team aims to explore questions such as what kind of visualisation works better for people, and what kind of impacts people care more about. 
As we conducted further research in the problem space, we decided to apply the concept of “collective awareness” to our design as well by not only visualizing personal contribution, but also emphasizing the importance of collective effort and action.
